# Synthetic spectra calculations


## 1. Necessary VALD lines lists

Obtained extract stellar linelists (short format) for 34 temperatures from 10500 to 31000 K, log g 3.5 or 4.0. 

Adopted 2 km/s microturbulence

These temperatures/gravities correspond to the range of observed stellar parameters. 

At this moment I can’t recall where those parameters came from. (GAW: Be_2019/WORKING/VALD)

The line lists are in the `00-InputMaterial/VALD-ShortList-AtmModels` folder of the Shared Google Drive. They are in the format `ap00k2_T-----G--.lst`
 

## 2. Compute the local synthetic spectra

For each unique model (see the `List of unique models` in the [00-InputInformation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M6y1Wnsrc-w5FjUMfKaSFa_-foIDAaMe8W4lYNWnWyk/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet), using `Synth3` to compute the local synthetic spectra at various angles. 

The executable code and user manual for `Synth3` can be found here:
[https://www.astro.uu.se/~oleg/synth3.html](https://www.astro.uu.se/~oleg/synth3.html)

In short, we need a VALD short list (see #1 above), as well as the accompanying model atmosphere that is listed towards the end of the line list file:


```
'He 1',       8996.9890,  23.0737, 2.0, -0.764, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 99.000, 0.010, '   3 wl:K   3 K   3 gf:K   3 K   3 K   3 K   3 K He            '
'castelli_ap00k2_T12000G40.krz',
'H :  0.92','He: -1.11', 'Li:-10.94','Be:-10.64','B : -9.49','C : -3.52','N : -4.12','O : -3.21',

```

The Kurucz atmopshere models, named appropriately, are in the same folder as the Short VALD list (see above). 

For each models, the following commands calculated the local intensity and creates a .mout file:

```
synth3.Darwin_Intel ap00k2_T-----G--.lst  T-----G--.mout
```

Gregg did this locally on his machine. 

The output files are in the `00-InputMaterial/Synth-local-spectra` folder of the Shared Google Drive. 


## 3. Compute the disk-integrated spectra (with rotational broadening)

On the Shared Google Drive, this is done in the 01-Synth-calculation folder. 

For each observed star, we compute a disk-integrated spectrum using Oleg’s `s3div` incorporating the star’s observed vsini. 

The vsini used are listed in the [00-InputInformation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M6y1Wnsrc-w5FjUMfKaSFa_-foIDAaMe8W4lYNWnWyk/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet. 

> TODO: check!! At this moment I can’t recall where the vsini came from. For the 2012 study it was from fitting the observed, cleaned LSD profiles. 
 
The executable code and manual for `s3div` are the same as for `Synth3` (see above). 

`s3div` takes the .mout file created above, and performs the disk integration with a specified vsini, vmacro. We can specify also the resolution of the output spectrum (in a grid with log(lambda) spacing), as well as the instrument resolution to convolve the spectrum with (e.g. 65000 for ESPaDOnS).

The command line syntax is as follow: 

```
s3di <input file> <output file> [ <v sin i> <vmacro> <Resol> <Instrum> ]
s3div  T15000G40.mout hd6226_1.dsk 120.00 2.0 167000 65000
```

As it turns out, Google Colab notebooks are able to run command line executable that lives on a mounted Google Drive (!!!!)

Therefore, the Synth executables (downloaded 2022-07-09) are in the folder `01-Synth-calculations/Synth-codes`. The colab notebook [01-Synth calculations]() FIX LINK runs `s3div.Linux` in a loop over the stars in Part 1, using the information in the spreadsheet. 

The output files (one per star in the sample) are in `01-Synth-calculations/Synth-diskint-spectra` folder of the Shared Drive. 

## 4. Radvel shift and noise

The next step is the apply a radial velocity correction (for each observation) and add statistical noise. The colab notebook [02-Synth_calculations](https://github.com/veropetit/BeStarsMiMeS/blob/master/02-Synth_calculations.ipynb) does this in Part 2. 

The procedure is as follow: 

1. Read in the original spectrum for an observation
2. Read in the rotationally broadened model spectrum that has been convolved with the instrument resolution by `s3div` already. WARNING: check the R value for the HARPS observation and modify the code accordingly?
3. Shift the model by the appropriate radial velocity for that observation (`VradCorrected` in the spreadsheet).
4. Split the observation into its orders (so this is assuming that the spectrum's orders have not been merged. If using a code that merges the order, then there should be an option to do this procedure in one swoop, instead of order by order. 
5. For each order, do the folloowing:
	* a. Interpolate the shifted model spectrum to the wavelength grid of the observed spectrum
	* b. Add some random noise to the interpolated model, using the observed error column as the sigma of the normal distribution.
	* c. Replace the observation.specI with the model (but keep all the other columns the same -- this way there is no need to stitch together the LSD profiles after the fact.
6. Splice the orders back together and save the resulting hybrid spectra in .s format.

The resulting hybrid spectra are located in the folder `01-Synth-calculations/Synth-hybrid-spectra` folder in the Shared Google Drive. 

Now, various masks (including Asif's cleaned masks) can be used directly on these spectra, to directly get hybrid LSD profiles.
